# Customer-Churn-Prediction

Customer attrition, also known as customer churn, customer turnover, or customer defection, is the loss of clients or customers. Predictive analytics use churn prediction models that predict customer churn by assessing their propensity of risk to churn. Since these models generate a small prioritized list of potential defectors, they are effective at focusing customer retention marketing programs on the subset of the customer base who are most vulnerable to churn.
